In my years of use and research for knowledge about technologies, there are some constants: GNU/Linux and Open Source. That said, I have been an active **Ubuntu Community** member (although I have used almost every flavour of GNU/Linux and after some years with Gentoo Linux, Iâ€™ve chosen to embrace this distribution from Canonical). With the help of Celso Martinho, founder of Sapo and owner of the domain, I have created and maintained the **Linux.PT** website referencing all Portuguese communities of any favour of GNI/Linux.

Over the years I have used, contributed to many Open Source projects and created some of my own. I try, when possible, to contribute to this idea of freedom and availability of technology and share my work or ideas. Unfortunately, in the last years I did not have the time to be more active in terms of sharing and I hope that I could do some more in the future.
