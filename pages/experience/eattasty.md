 Today I am working has Head of Technology at EatTasty, an online platform for cooking and delivering food. Where all the meals are cooked by a local network of restaurants, collected and delivered in an operation completely controlled by us. The meals are delivered to our clients ready to eat.

I serve a team responsible for imagining, developing and delivering technology solutions and services that will help business successfully meet profitability and productivity goals. Introducing pilot solutions that are rolled out globally. 

It all started with Rui Costa, the co-founder of EatTasty, that worked with me at Publico.PT, by inviting me to help him with a project that later became EatTasty. Initially I worked in my free time to make the initial pilot of the application.  But the business was always shifting and the code and architecture was always evolving and getting bigger.  More and more features added. Help operations, drivers, sales and customer support. Integrating multiple payments gateways and invoicing system. A route management and optimisation to get the faster and optimised delivery. All parts of the business needed  some kind of help, and all the technology was made in-house.

Later came the analytics of the business, the KPI’s, the OKR’s, the predictions.  The architecture needed to scale, the team needed to scale. A couple years later, I was working full time and leading a hand chosen DevOps, Software and QA engineers to help EatTasty to achieve its goals.

At EatTasty, I had the oportunity to implement and use several technologies and platforms. To mention some of them:
- Kubernettes, Docker and AWS
- NodeJS in the Backend
- React Native for the mobile apps
- MongoDB for the main database, scaled in multiple servers with replica sets and Redis for caching.
- RabbitMQ for queuing tasks
