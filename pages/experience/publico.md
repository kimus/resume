At, Publico.PT, I was part of a team that had the achievement to modernise all their sites and platform integrated in a team managed by **WeDO** and using the **ViaTecla** CMS **on Microsoft Windows Servers**.  A part was very specific to be able to be done in ViaTecla at that time, the cinemas and cultural events were too complex and very interchangeable information (like timetable, actors and directors, etc). And so, the **Cinecartaz** and **Guia do Lazer** sites are migrated to a new and custom CMS platform made from scratch in **ASP** (Javascript), **XML** and **XSLT** templates.  Later the Guia do Lazer was also used in **Clix**.

After, I have also implemented an export tool to get information about cinema and cultural events directly to the Público newspaper pages.
