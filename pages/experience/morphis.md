A couple years after, I was at Morphis, I’ve worked in migrating legacy to modern platforms. mostly from Oracle Forms, I was part of the core team.  I’ve worked with .NET C# and Java Enterprise applications, NodeJS, Angular and React, etc Further modernizingand complementing the Morphis Frames product.

Here I had also the oportunity to implement a set of tools and methodologies that still are being used today. By defining the way software development and releases could use technologiy to aid the bysiness. I’ve used virtualization technologies like VMWare, Virtualbox, KVM and Docker containers. Build tools like Maven, Gradle, Ant, Grunt and test our applications with Selenium. 

And this methodologies helped us to work with **Ellucian**, helping them to migrate their Banner product from **Oracle Forms** to our Java / Frames application.
