At **Morphis**, related to  **ATX Technologies**, I have worked in migrating legacy to modern platforms. mostly from **Oracle Forms**, I was part of the core team.  I have worked with **.NET C#** and **Java Enterprise** applications, **NodeJS**, **Angular** and **React**, etc Further modernizingand complementing the **Morphis Frames** product.

I was back where I have ended, to the **XPL**, and now we needed to evolve to multiplatform, was a time of several UI technologies, like **Adobe Flex** and **Microsoft XAML**. And so, I have started working on a multioutput rendering engine that could support several UI targets and all the support core libraries in those frameworks for data binding, components, formatting and validation.

The **Adobe Flex**, with a **Java** backend, was initially used by **SoulMV - MV Sistemas** - Brasil, a medical platform used in Hospitals. We have migrated from Oracle Forms to a more modern web-based platform. I have also created all the **Ant** configurations and scripts  to help bootstrap and maintain this large project. Later, and because the Adobe Flex was deprecated,  we migrated to the latest, and higher performant, Morphis Frames and Foundations.

Finally, some technologies were depreciating and we needed a more modernised and multi-backend solution (**C#** or **Java**). Developed from scratch, the new product version, named Morphis Frames, and the backends named Morphis Foundations, started to be born. Now with the following:
- a UI compiler, and with the possibility of having UI rules and extensibility (a module could be extended - by adding new features / components to the pages).
- A visual designer integrated with Eclipse and Visual Studio, to create UI specifications by dragging and dropping components
- A backend simulator, to transform a recorder session in a replicable environment for testing or demos without needing a real backend.
- And a testing framework, based on Sellenium and WebDriver IO, to make it very simple to test the UI interactions (mostly for testing the migration and regressions).

This new product was used at MV Sistemas, and in **Ellucian**, a university software platform from U.S.A. Ellucian was migrating their Ellucian Banner from Oracle Forms to Morphis Frames and Foundations (Java) with hundreds of complex modules and components. I have created the initial project using **Java Spring**,  **Maven** and configure a private Maven repository to deploy our artefacts. Later, I have also worked with the Ellucian UX team to guide them to achieve better UI/UX from the final product. Also, crucial to Ellucian, was the requirement to the application to achieve the best **Web Accessibility** possible to work with screen readers and make their application accessible to people with disabilities. Later, these products were both by Ellucian and the team is still working to evolve their application and products.

Here I also had the opportunity to implement a set of tools and methodologies that are still being used today. By defining the way software development and releases could use technology to aid the business. I have used virtualization technologies like **VMWare**, **Virtualbox**, **KVM** and **Docker** containers. Build tools like **Maven**, **Gradle**, **Ant**, **Grunt** and test our applications with **Selenium**.
And this methodology helped us work with Ellucian, helping them migrate their Banner product from Oracle Forms to our Java/Frames application.

Has a side note, ATX or Morphis, were always companies that were close to universities and the PLX/XPL or Frames, were subjects of several master’s degree papers where I was the coordinator (or drive). I could not be more proud to have so many great people taking about a product that I have contributed so much.

Before I have left Morphis, we were starting to evolve the product to new technologies like Angular and React. They are using all the React components in their Morphis Cuscos product.
