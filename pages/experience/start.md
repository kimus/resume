I firstly worked in architecture, drawing plants in AutoCAD.  My father worked for a national entity that manages the cultural heritage  buildings of Portugal  (Directorate General for Cultural Heritage). This drawing tools was my first encounter with programming languages - LISP and Basic.

After a while, I started making games using Visual Basic for fun. And one day, a neighbour living next door, checked my work and took me to a software company. And that's how it started, from building architecture to software.
