Knowing João Bernardino, when working at uúblico.PT, I've been asked to help him on a big project for the Portuguese government. The site of Portuguese Heritage - **Património Cultural** - Direcção-geral do Património Cultural. Here, I've chosen the **Django** web framework , using **Python** language, and **Oracle** database, to develop this website, that is still in production today. Also made an open-source Django extensions: **Django Blocks** , a tool to better support multi language and page navigations, and **Image POI** that could be used to pick the image point of interest for better cropping.

At this time, I've also done some guest teacher and give some lectures at **Escola Superior Artística do Porto-Guimarães (ESAP Guimarães)** to give to the students a more technical perspective on how the design should be used in conjunction with web technologies. Where not only the design is an important part (because is visible) but also how the web page structure (and proper tags) are important to display the textual and media contents. Especially for people with disabilities, and for robots and any other readers or screeners (that do not care about the design).
