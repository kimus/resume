Initially I have started with CGI scripts in **ANSI C** and **Pearl**, in **Linux** environments. Later evolved to better platform using the PHP language.

When starting in PHP I add a personal project to work on a platform to manage **WinREST** licences. But after a wile there was a need to have a tool that could be used to manage sites and their content. That was done mixing SQL code and rendering code in a **PHP** file and in the end of the finished product was hard to maintain of evolve. And so, because I don’t like mixing data handling and templates in the same PHP file (or any other technology) I have stated to create a tool that could separate retrieving data and rendering data. I have called it  **WMS - Web Management System**, a CMS a PHP tool that helps manage configurable and localised content types (models) to be created, edited and stored in the database. With the help of a powerful API, used in PHP pages to get and display the contents. This CMS was used at several sites with the most noticeable one being the portal of the famous Portuguese band - **Xutos e Pontapés**. This CRM is still in use today.
