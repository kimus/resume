I believe that technology has important effects on business and affects the culture, efficiency and relationships.  A business that has a technological capacity to shift will stay a step ahead of its competition. But not everything requires a technical solution. Technology adds value through innovations, not operations.

I am passionate about developing a collaborative culture where people can continually learn and grow, and a firm believer that, when teams are at their strongest and most cohesive, they can deliver more effective results.

For me, colleagues and family are important. Without them no passion pulls us to go further. To exceed our limits and support each other in good and bad moments. And if that is not enough, I hold my guitar and look for inspiration in a good riff.
