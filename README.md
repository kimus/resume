# Resume

A single-page, two-column resume for software developers (or others). It uses the base Nunjuks templates and fonts to provide ease of use and configuration when trying to update the resume.


# Motivation

I created this template as managing a resume a word processor, or other publishing tools, was hard and changing any formatting was too difficult since it had to be applied in multiple places. Also, I wanted to be hable to have a way for versioning, markdown support and easily applying formatting rules.


# Roadmap

- [x] initial dark and light themes
- [ ] multiple theme support
- [ ] PDF output generation
- [ ] GitHub Actions
